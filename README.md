# File Tracker

This is a simple file tracker. Usage will require only git and dvc (and python
for pre-commit)

## Requirements

- [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- dvc can be installed by either running `pip install dvc`, or via the installer
  on the [dvc website](https://dvc.org/doc/install)

## What is remaining?

- Set up changelog generation
- Set up (or find) simple procedure to automatically run `dvc commit data` or
  similar during staging or pre-commit
- Turn into cookiecutter
